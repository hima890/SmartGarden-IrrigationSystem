# SmartGarden-IrrigationSystem
Create a smart irrigation system for a garden that automatically waters plants based on soil moisture levels and weather forecasts. You can control and monitor the system through a GUI developed with PySide, hosted on a Flask server. The ESP32 will interface with sensors and control the irrigation system.
